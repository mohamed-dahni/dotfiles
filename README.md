# Dotfiles Repository - Configuration Files for a Productive Development Environment

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-dotfiles-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! Here, you'll find a collection of configuration files that I use to customize my development environment, enhancing productivity and improving my workflow. These dotfiles include settings for Vim, aliases, and various bash-related configurations, all tailored to suit my preferences and needs.

## Contents

- `.vim`: Configuration files for Vim, a powerful text editor.
- `.aliases`: Handy aliases to simplify frequently used commands.
- `.bash_profile`: Customizations for the Bash shell on startup.
- `.bash_prompt`: Personalized Bash prompt settings.
- `.bashrc`: Additional Bash configurations.
- `.vimrc`: Vim-specific settings.

## How to Use

**Note: Before proceeding, make sure to back up your existing dotfiles if you have any, as the following steps will replace them.**

#### Clone the Repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

#### Installation Script:

Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
```

Run the installation script to set up the dotfiles:
```bash
    ./install.sh
```

The script will intelligently create symbolic links to the appropriate locations for the dotfiles (e.g., ~/.vimrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.), preserving your original files in case you had them.

#### Customization:
Feel free to explore the individual dotfiles and make any necessary adjustments according to your preferences. You can modify the Vim settings, add or edit aliases, and tweak the Bash prompt to suit your needs.
